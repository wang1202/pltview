Changelog
=========

v0.3.0
------
- Map mode UI: Map properties popup with color controls and layer toggles
- Map layers: load overlays from map_layers/*.json with auto-detection by bounds

------
- Fix quiver components not updating when switching slice axis (e.g., Z to Y) while quiver is enabled

v0.2.0
------
- Multi-level AMR overlay: Overlay higher refinement levels on top of coarser levels for composite visualization
- Fix zero-value filling: Resolved issue where gaps between AMR boxes were incorrectly filled with zeros
- Fix pip install from git: Compiled binary is now properly bundled in the wheel, so "pip install git+..." works correctly
